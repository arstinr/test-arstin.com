Create a project with the following specifications:

### Project Structure
- The project should have the following file and folder layout:
  ```
  project/
  ├── public/
  │   ├── videos/
  │   │   ├── video1.mp4
  │   │   ├── video2.mp4
  │   │   ├── video3.mp4
  │   ├── videos.json  # JSON file listing the video paths
  ├── index.html       # Main HTML file
  ├── app.js           # JavaScript logic
  ├── style.css        # CSS for styling
  ```

### Functionality
1. **Full-Screen Video Background:**
   - The website should display a full-screen video that plays in the background.
   - Videos should play in random order, selected from a list defined in `videos.json`.
   - The video should autoplay, loop, and be muted by default.

2. **Random Video Logic:**
   - Use vanilla JavaScript to fetch the list of videos from `videos.json`.
   - Randomly select a video each time the page loads.

3. **Styling:**
   - Use CSS to make the video cover the entire screen without distortion (`object-fit: cover`).

4. **File Contents:**
   - **`videos.json`**: A JSON file containing an array of video paths.
   - **`index.html`**: An HTML file that includes a `<video>` tag and links the CSS and JavaScript.
   - **`style.css`**: A CSS file that styles the video to cover the entire screen.
   - **`app.js`**: A JavaScript file to load the video list and apply the randomization logic.

### Hosting and Usage
- The project should be deployable via GitHub and connectable to a Vercel deployment.


### Deliverables
- A complete project folder structure with all files implemented.
- Include a `README.md` file with instructions for:
  - Running the project locally.
  - Adding or removing videos by updating `videos.json` and the `public/videos` folder.
